# What-is-this
## To answer the question proposed in the title of this absolute work of artistic brilliance, this was one of the first web pages that I ever built.
* What prompted this masterpiece is beyond me, it felt as if it created itself and I was merely a vessel.
## This project has caused me to ask the question what is art?
* Is art merely a meaningless expression of oneself or is it more? Alas, I say art is more. For What is a culture without art? Art separates the
  sentient from the nonsentient. That is the true purpose of this work of art, it is to get the observer to understand the true purpose of art itself.
